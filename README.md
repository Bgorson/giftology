TODO:
When a quiz is completed- check if the user is signed in, if they are- updated their entry in the database.
If they aren't- show a message asking if they want to save their results

Once I'm able to save them- make sure that I can retrive them with button press on profile

Once they can be displayed- allow them to be deleted

If duplicate quiz detected, ask user if they want to create a new quiz or update the old one

Add heart icon so user can favorite products. When a product is favorited, make a put request to add it to the array for that quiz section

Once I'm able to add and remove favorites, have a button to show all the favorites of a quiz. Make a route that receives the ID of the quiz and returns all the favorites of that quiz
